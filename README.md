# ITF-py: Parser and Encoder for the ITF Trace Format

Python library to parse and emit Apalache ITF traces. Refer to [ADR015][] for
the format. ITF traces are emitted by [Apalache][] and [Quint][].

**No fluff.** We keep this library intentionally minimalistic. You can use it in
your projects without worrying about pulling dozens of dependencies.
